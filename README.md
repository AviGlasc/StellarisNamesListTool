Hello! And welcome to Avi's Stellaris NamesList Tool, I've tried to design the system to be as simple as possible, but please feel free to reach out with suggestions or questions if you have any!		
		
Getting Started:

Copy this google sheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GpY67q_PQ5TbjV4x9hqWE4KWJxhgVF0coUvGhxl-C4o/edit?usp=sharing)
	
 * Share this copy with your playgroup and give them editing perms
 * There's a 'tutorial' page with all of the tutorials, tips, limitations, and warnings

Download the tool by clicking "code<>" > "download zip" 

 * Install the neccesary libraries by running "pip install pandas openpyxl requests" in your command prompt
 * Make sure to have Python 3.13 or newer installed (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  
If you have any problems I can provide limited assistance providing that I have the time/energy, contact me with bugs/suggestions/help requests at my email: avilynnglasc@gmail.com
Have fun and goodluck with your runs!

*********************************************************************************************
Planned Expansions:
  * Sequential Naming support (requires localization file integration) [Complete!]
  * Error check for incorrectly edited sheets
  * QOL enhancements for sheet/tool [complete!... more coming]

Potential Expansions:
  * Name generation assistance
  * Support for fully custom empire creation
  * Handling using official modding capacity
*********************************************************************************************

NOTE:

This tool does NOT create the modfile for you (as of now), it simply makes the nameslists files andassumes that you are adding them to the gamefiles directly! If you wish to create a steam/paradox workshop mod to more easily share the lists with your playgroup, there are many online resources for learning to do so!
