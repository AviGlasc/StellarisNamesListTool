Hello! And welcome to Avi's Stellaris NamesList Tool, I've tried to design the system to be as simple as possible, but please feel free to reach out with suggestions or questions if you have any!		
		
To get started, open up and make a copy of this google sheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GpY67q_PQ5TbjV4x9hqWE4KWJxhgVF0coUvGhxl-C4o/edit?usp=sharing), and download the tool by clicking "code<>" > "download zip" 
  Share this copy with your playgroup and give them editing perms
  There's a 'tutorial' page with all of the tutorials, tips, limitations, and warnings.
  
If you have any problems I can provide limited assistance providing that I have the time/energy, contact me with bugs/suggestions/help requests at my email: avilynnglasc@gmail.com
Have fun and goodluck with your runs!
